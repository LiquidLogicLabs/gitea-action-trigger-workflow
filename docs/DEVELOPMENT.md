npm run release:minor  # Create minor release
npm run release:major  # Create major release
```

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing documentation.

## Releasing

This project uses `standard-version` for automated release tag creation with commit summaries.

### Pre-Release Checklist

1. All local tests pass: `npm test`
2. Build succeeds: `npm run build`
3. Linter passes: `npm run lint`
4. CI workflow has passed

### Creating a Release

```bash
npm run release:patch  # Patch release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
npm run release:minor  # Minor release (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
npm run release:major  # Major release (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
```

The release command automatically bumps version, analyzes commits, creates git commit and tag with commit summary, and pushes to trigger the GitHub Actions release workflow.
